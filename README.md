A simple Python script to download MP3 files from an RSS feed. 

This is the first coding project I've ever done, I'm trying to learn Python and this seems like a cute lil idea to start with. Plus I wanted to download a podcast but I can't find a program I like myself. 

This really works now! :3 
- Enter an RSS feed and it will show you the name, the number of episodes available and the date range of episodes found.
- Either download all episodes, choose a date range of episodes to download, or list all episodes if you don't know the dates of the episodes you want to download.
- Option to choose the folder you download the episodes to or use the default folder (attempts to use User/Downloads)
- Formats episode titles in case they have non-allowed characters for files.
