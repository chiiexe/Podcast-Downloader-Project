A simple Python script to download MP3 files from an RSS feed. 

This is the first coding project I've ever done, I'm trying to learn Python and this seems like a cute lil idea to start with. Plus I wanted to download a podcast but I can't find a program I like myself. 

Right now this is broken, it only works if you want to download all episodes from a feed, but it works in *some* capacity I guess. Eventually I want to add a way to insert metadata into the MP3s such as thumbnail and dates, as well as a very basic GUI to be easier to use.
